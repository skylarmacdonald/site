Owing to some sort of major global event, I don't currently have any live shows planned. I will update this page when that changes.

## Past shows

In 2019, I did [*Skylar MacDonald's Fact Machine*]({% link _projects/factmachine.md %}) at the Edinburgh Fringe.

I was also a frequent host of the [*Electric Cabaret*](http://www.cthefestival.com/2019/the-electric-cabaret) at C venues, and appeared at *Cis-tem Reboot* at Bedlam Late Night.
