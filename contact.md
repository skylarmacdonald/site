I am on [Mastodon](https://{{ site.mastodon[0].instance| cgi_escape | escape }}/@{{ site.mastodon[0].username| cgi_escape | escape }}), [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/skylar.lol) and [Instagram](https://instagram.com/{{ site.instagram_username| cgi_escape | escape }}), in descending order of how often I remember to update them. I try and respond to messages on there, but I can't promise to do so quickly or respond to everyone. I'm no longer on Twitter/X.

If you want to write me an email, you can contact me using the form below. I don't have a team of people looking at these emails — they all come to me — so it may take me some time to respond. But I will do my best to get back to you!

<form action="https://formspree.io/f/mzboawbj" method="POST">
  <label for="name">Name:</label>
  <input type="text" name="name" id="name" autocomplete="name" required />

  <label for="email">Email address:</label>
  <input type="email" name="email" id="email" autocomplete="email" required />
  
  <label for="message">Your message:</label>
  <textarea name="message" id="message" required></textarea>

  <input type="text" name="_gotcha" />
  
  <button type="submit">Send</button>
</form>

If you want to get me to do comedy for you, you should speak to [DSG Entertainment](https://dsg.lol).
