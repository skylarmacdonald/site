title: Someone asked me about Shania Twain, and it's the best interview I've ever done

## *Let's go, girls!*

This is barely a blog post. I just wanted to share that [Jake Hall](https://www.clippings.me/jakehall) spoke with me about Shania Twain's 1997 smash hit *Man, I Feel Like A Woman!* and its unintentional queer legacy. It is, to date, the best thing I've ever been interviewed for.

That's all.
