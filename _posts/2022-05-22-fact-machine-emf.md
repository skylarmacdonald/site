title: I'm doing Fact Machine again!
---

I know, wild, right?!

Owing to some sort of major global event, I haven't performed [*Fact Machine*]({% link _projects/factmachine.md %}) since the Edinburgh Fringe in 2019. **UNTIL NOW!**

I'm delighted to say that I'll be performing it at [EMF 2022](https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2022/305-skylar-macdonalds-fact-machine). Full details are still yet to be confirmed at the time of writing, but I can say for definite that it will be at some point between the 2nd and 5th of June, in a field somewhere in Ledbury. More info is on the [EMF website](https://emfcamp.org).

I'm thrilled to be doing this show again after so long away from it, and I hope that you'll come along if you're going to EMF this year. I will do my best to remember all the jokes. (PowerPoint is helpful for that...)

In the meantime, [go and add my entry in the programme to your favourites](https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2022/305-skylar-macdonalds-fact-machine) to convince the scheduling robots to give me a good time slot.

Post-EMF, I don't currently have any more performances of *Fact Machine* planned, but I'm hoping to get some in the diary. (In other words, if you work for a London venue you should *definitely* book me. I'm extremely good value and do all my own stunts.)

Until next time,
