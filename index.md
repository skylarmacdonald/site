![Skylar MacDonald]({% link assets/photo.jpg %}){:#main_photo}

Hi, I'm Skylar MacDonald. I am the woman in this photo of me.

I tell silly jokes and pretend to be people. I'm often found in front of a PowerPoint.

Ostensibly, this website is also a blog, where I will write about what I'm up to when I remember to do so.

I'm also on [Mastodon](https://{{ site.mastodon[0].instance| cgi_escape | escape }}/@{{ site.mastodon[0].username| cgi_escape | escape }}), which I use ever so slightly more frequently, but mostly just for my silly thoughts.
