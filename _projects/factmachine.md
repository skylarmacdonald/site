>Skylar MacDonald loves facts. Or, more accurately, she loves using facts to prove her points. Join her and her well researched PowerPoint to find out why cancer causes mobile phones, how mean single people are about wine, and why Italian yoghurt adverts are a force to be reckoned with. You'll learn the best things to lie about to find a date online and you'll get an insight into the minds of the kind of people who review headboards on online stores.

Fact Machine was my 2019 Edinburgh Fringe show. It was a tongue-in-cheek stand up PowerPoint presentation about the things you can prove with facts and figures, as long as you're not too fussy about things like "accuracy" and "journalistic integrity".

There are currently no further performances of this show scheduled, but never say never...
